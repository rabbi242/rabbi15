		<h1>Ceasefire Outdoor & Perimeter Detectors</h1>

			<h2>The risk begins far beyond your front door.</h2>

	<div id="fast">

<p><span>S</span>ecurity measures that alert you to break-ins to<br />your premises still leave you vulnerable. That’s<br />because they allow the threat to infiltrate the<br />building before alerting you. Not only does this<br />put you in danger, it needlessly endangers your<br />
loved ones and your property.</p>

<p>Appointing security guards might provide a<br />measure of security, but it doesn’t ensure your<br />property is completely secured. Not only is there<br />room for human error on the part of the most<br />diligent guard, all it takes is a moment’s<br />inattention for burglars to force their way into your<br />property.</p>

<p>When it comes to threats, an offensive approach<br />is always better than a defensive one. Keeping the<br />need for intensive security measures in mind,<br />Ceasefire now provides a foolproof security<br />system that stops burglars in their tracks, before<br />
they can penetrate your property. Ceasefire<br />presents Vigil – an alarm-based security system<br />that secures the gates and walls around your<br />property.</p>
